# Armored Core 6 - Build Randomizer
## What is this project
As stated by the very name of the project, it's a build randomizer for AC6. This was created cause I wanted to shake up the gameplay a little, make stuff more fun and all. Once you complete the game there kinda isn't a lot to do besides PvP with really bad netcode lol. So what if I gave myself smth to do? As such, I'm making this randomizer! Unfortunately I don't have the knowledge or experience to mod the game and make a full on in game randomizer, so instead, this is a web app!

Basically, you use it to generate a build, and then you copy in-game. It's a manual process yeah, unfortunate. But still, it's better than not having a randomizer. I am also aware there are already randomizers out there, but the ones I found lacked some options I really wanted, and like, they weren't pretty so I made my own (not tryna flame y'alls randomizers lmao).

## All the functionality
### Randomize All Parts
If you want to randomize all parts, just click on the Randomize Build button. This will generate a build on 2 conditions: it doesn't go over the EN LOAD, and doesn't go over the ARMS LOAD. These are default and you can't change. I mean you literally can't even play the videogame with your mecha if it's over 100% EN LOAD so I figured that's okay.

You can however change one option, which is to include Overweight mechas on the rotation, if you want an extra possible challenge. Just uncheck the "Disable Overweight on Full Randomize" box and do full randomize.

### Randomize Individual Parts
For this one, none of the above rules apply. If you randomize an individual part, it will not account for EN LOAD, ARMS LOAD or even Weight, it will ignore it.

### Other Stuff
So first, there's a button for Randomizing Missions if you don't feel like deciding which one you wanna go yourself. Besides that, there's 2 checkboxes that allow you to enable and disable Arms Weapons in the Back Rotation, in case you want to include the possibility of builds with weapon swap instead of back weapons. These affect both full rotations or single rotations.

Besides that, you can see the current EN LOAD, ARMS LOAD and Weight of the build. It will warn you for going over any of them!

That is all, hope you like using it
